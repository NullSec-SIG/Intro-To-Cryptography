To start, simply convert the chinese character to pinyin (thus the name pinyin) e.g: å’Œ will be 'He' and you take the first letter. (thus the line "take the first one, as it will lead the way.")
coverting it will leave you with the text: `i&h-uy~)hu'uywd*uif{wauy~'d)i{` 

Now, using https://www.dcode.fr/xor-cipher, XOR decrypt and use the 1st value. your text should now be: `y6x=ein9xe7eigt:eyvkgqein7t9yk`
they should be able to know that they need to use XOR as the line "Xtra hard if yOu ask me, i would Rather sleep." would hide the clue, taking all the captial letters will
give you "XOR"

After obtaining the text, they need to shift the ASCII value of the text by 6, again the clue for ASCII is in "mAybe the anSwer you seek is somewhere hidden in plain sight. Catch me if you can, I don't think you would. In my humble opinion." taking the captial letter will give you "ASCII", for the key is 6 is hidden in "count your lines, as the final hour in upon us." There are a total 6 lines. so you shift by 6. giving you the Plain text: `s0r7y_ch3r_1_can4_speak_ch1n3se`


*TD;LR: obtain the first letter of the chinese character, send it thru a XOR decrypter and shift the ASCII value of the charaters by 6 to obtain the key "s0r7y_ch3r_1_can4_speak_ch1n3se"*
